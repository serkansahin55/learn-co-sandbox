NDS to Insight Strategy
-----------------------
1. Understand the NDS
2. "Pretty-Print" NDS with pp
3. Home-Grown Pretty-Print NDS
4. Use [] to verify your understanding from Step 1
5. Print values to verify your understanding
6. Leave code comments and documentation for yourself
7. Wrap uses of [] from Step 2 into new methods
8. Create simple methods with meaningful names ("First-Order Methods")
9. Ensure "First-Order Methods" use arguments to create flexibility
10. See-saw between bottom-up and top-down method writing
11. Write a method that provides an insight e.g. oldest_student
12. Evaluate your First Order Methods
13. Can you use your First-Order Methods to build the insight method's implementation?
YES: Great! Your method is done!
NO: Build a new method that combines other methods to get closer to what the insight method needs. Repeat step 4
Insight method provides an insight! We're done!
